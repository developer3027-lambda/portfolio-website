				<p>Many of my friends, just getting into coding have Windows machines and are wondering why so many
				professionals are using Mac. They are starting to get into git and bash and find Windows difficult to
				deal with. Windows is an amazing Operating System. There is a reason why it is number one in the
				business market, but for a programmer or designer, there are better choices. I do not claim to be a
				professional and I would never claim that one OS is better than another.</p>

				<p>I would like to take a moment and layout a quick alternative OS idea that will run on your Win 10
				machine and will have you sailing through git on a bash terminal in just a few minuets without major
				reconfiguring of your Win 10 machine.</p>

				<p>I have a Win 10 think pad and when it came time to install a terminal, I got a headache. Let me back up.
				I tried a few different code editors before landing on VS Code. For me though, VS Code was my dream come
				true. There are so many extensions to make your coding life easier and it's terminal integration is
				awesome. However, I found myself jumping through hoops when it came to the terminal, or git. I went into
				the system settings and installed the Linux / bash settings, went on-line and found a preferred
				terminal, all that stuff, but there was always some obstacle in my way. After a few days of fighting it,
				I came to the conclusion, there is a better way.</p>

				<p>So windows was not the OS I wanted and I was trying to make it conform. Sure it can be done, many have
				and it works just fine for them. I know that given enough time and with more research and compromise, I
				could also come to the same conclusion, but we don't have to. You can run a Linux Virtual Machine on
				your Win 10 machine and never have these issues again. If you are interested in trying this yourself,
				here are some guidelines to follow.</p>

				<p><a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">Oracle VirtualBox</a> Download and install Oracle VM VirtualBox. (The user manual is very helpful)
				 Download the <a href="https://ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a> desktop ISO.</p>
				<h3>Enjoy your new found freedom!</h3>
				<p>Now, of course there are a few steps between here and there, like the setting up of the VM and then
				installing the ISO, but compared to putting windows in a box, I would go this route every time.</p>

				<p>Oracle VM VirtualBox is a virtual machine. It will run on nearly all OS, but we have been talking about
				Win 10, so we will stay the course. This virtual machine will create a environment that other OS, such
				as Linux, can run in without causing conflict with your native OS, Win 10. First you will set up a
				system, sort of like designing your own computer, inside your computer. The first thing you will do is
				name your new system, and assign it the OS concept, then you will assign such things as how much memory,
				CPU, and virtual disk space to use. Click the green add sign or new, and the wizard will take you
				through the entire process of setting up your new machine.</p>

				<p>You can use any Linux OS you would like. If you would like to do some research please take a look around
				the Distro Watch. https://distrowatch.com/, but I recommend starting with Ubuntu. It has the widest
				range of support and would be the easiest to work with. Not to mention, it has a simple, nice and light
				bash terminal to play with. Download the ISO from https://ubuntu.com/ and use it as a virtual disk to
				install the Ubuntu OS on your newly made VM. You will probably find that the VM acts a little funny. The
				mouse and keyboard may act like they are stuck and the desktop size of the VM is small while it will
				look bloated in the window. This is because the VM is loading in sort of a safe mode. You will insert a
				virtual disk called Guest Additions and load those drivers. On reboot your system will shine like a
				brand new penny. Again I would refer you to the wonderful documentation of the VM Manual. The internet
				is full of resource material on this subject. If you are wanting a great intro to the Oracle VirtualBox,
				Ubuntu, and a solid foundation of the bash terminal or Linux commands, then give this video a go.
				https://youtu.be/wBp0Rb-ZJak. I do not know this gentleman but I do know this video is on point.</p>

				<p>Once you are ready to install a code reader and editor, may I suggest VS Code. I would also suggest
				getting it through snapd. With Linux you will get software from repositories. Snapd is one such
				repository and will come with newer versions of Ubuntu. You may find that information here,
				https://snapcraft.io/install/code/ubuntu. I would encourage you to take a look around the repository. It
				is where I got Spotify for my Fedora system.</p>

				<p>I hope this helps. I feel I made it sound more complicated than it really is. For me, this was a much
				better alternative to trying to fight with windows to make it do what I wanted. This way everything just
				works, right out of the box, with very little problems, if any. Not to mention the fun of playing with
				all the different types of OS out there. I liked Fedora so much I put it on a Dell Inspiron to improve
				its performance. I love this little machine.</p>

				<p>If you have any questions, concerns, would like some assistance getting it done, or have done this and
				want to share stories, please give me a shout. I would love to help, or talk with you.</p>
